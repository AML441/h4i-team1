## Reflection

- Challenges
    - Merge Conflicts
        - Since we usually worked alone, we never had to deal with merge conflicts before. Throughout this project, we had to learn how to create branches, merge them, and handle any conflicting sections of code. 
    - Conflicting Schedules
        - With midterms and finals season approaching, we had to learn how to balance academics and work. 

- Lessons Learned
    - The Importance of Communication
        - We realized that we needed to communicate our issues and amount of progress made no matter how minor, or else we'd risk of two people doing the same task or realizing that something hadn't been implemented yet

    - Planning out the Types/Interfaces FIRST
        - We could've saved time by mapping out the different interfaces we would use at the very beginning, rather than going back and making edits later. 

- Overall Thoughts
    - Our team learned a great deal from this experience, both technical and personal aspects. While we were only given 2 weeks, we were able to accomplish so much. We hope you admire this product as much as we do.
